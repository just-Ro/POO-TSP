/**
 * The PheroGraph class represents a graph used for pheromone levels in ant colony optimization.
 * It extends the AGraph<Integer, Double> class, which provides the basic graph structure and operations.
 * Pheromone levels are stored as edge weights in the graph.
 * The class allows for updating the pheromone levels of edges and retrieving information about the graph.
 * 
 * Pheromone levels are updated using the {@link #updateEdge(int, int, double)} method, which adds a value to an edge.
 * The class also overrides the {@link #toString()} method to provide a string representation of the adjacency matrix
 * of the graph, displaying the pheromone levels of each edge.
 * 
 * This class assumes that the pheromone levels are represented as {@code double} values.
 * Negative pheromone levels are not allowed, and any resulting negative value is set to zero.
