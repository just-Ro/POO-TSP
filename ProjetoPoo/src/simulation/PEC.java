/**
 * The PEC (Priority Event Container) class implements the IPEC interface and represents a container for events in a simulation.
 * It uses a TreeSet to store events in a sorted order based on their event time.
 * This class is responsible for adding events to the container, retrieving the next event, and checking if the container is empty.
 * 
 * Example usage:
 * PEC pec = new PEC();
 * IEvent event = new Event(...);
 * pec.addEventPEC(event);
 * IEvent nextEvent = pec.nextEventPEC();
 * 
 * Note: The actual implementation of the IEvent interface is not shown here.
 * The PEC class assumes that the IEvent interface and its implementing classes exist and have appropriate functionality.
